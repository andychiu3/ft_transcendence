## If wanna check the project locally

Get the repo
```bash
git clone <URL> ft_transcendence
```

Change Directory and make sure `docker` is running before using `Makefile` to compile
```bash
cd ft_transcendence && make
```

Open the browser
```bash
https://localhost
```
**Note:** ssl/tls is set to be self-signed so the browser may ask you to accept the risk.


Dev mode is also available since the frontend is build with vite
```bash
localhost:5173
```

.env is included which does not include any sensitive credentials but some of the variable to prevent hard coding.  
**Note:** Some authentication features require additional environment variables:
- Google OAuth: Requires `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` 
- Email 2FA: Requires `SENDER_EMAIL` and `SENDER_PW`
- Authenticator app 2FA works out of the box

Contact the repository owner for the required credentials.
